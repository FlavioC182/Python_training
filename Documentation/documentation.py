"""
This module contains the fundamental of code documenting.
"""

# In this lecture we are going to cover code documenting.

# We can add a documentation to each module we create.
# To read the documentation of a certain module we can do:

import os

print (os.__doc__)

# This line of code will print the documentation of the module os.

# We can create the documentation for our own modules, by writing it
# inside """[...]"""


# We can have documentations for functions too:

def myFunction():
    """This function does nothing"""
    print ("Function")
